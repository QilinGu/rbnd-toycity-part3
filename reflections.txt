1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Around 6 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
1) The way of breaking down the task into small pieces, especially the complex ones with mutiple classes like this.
2) Using class attributes and methods in Ruby

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
1) Add "brand" attribute to Product as well as find_by_brand method, because it makes this app closer to the hierarchy of a pratical inventory system
2) Add a feature of finding all transactions for a specific product, as I think it's a important summary and information of an inventory system.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I feel I am not writing Ruby in the most efficient way, and I could do better on coding style.
